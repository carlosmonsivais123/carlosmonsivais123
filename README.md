• Software: Tableau (TabPy, Calculated Field Coding) and Microsoft (MS) Excel, including Pivot Tables and Macros, plus MS Word and PowerPoint

• Cloud Tools: Google Cloud (BigQuery, Dataprep, Google Cloud SDK)

<b>Education</b></br>
I am currently pursuing a M.S in Data Science at Indiana University Bloomington where I am expected to graduate in May 2023; I earned a B.S in Statistics and a B.A in Economics at the University of California, Davis in June 2019.
